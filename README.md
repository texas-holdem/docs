# Overview

Texas hold'em is a beloved game, especially among friends.

Gambling is prohibited in many countries(while profitable in many others),  
which makes it hard to find a trustworthy, cross-platform app to use.

So we wanted to build one, with fully open sourced algorithm and pipeline,  
to make every dealt card trackable and explainable(while unpredictable, of course),  
thus trustable.
